# Genetic Signature EXPlorer (GSEXP)

We provide a command-line tool used for fast and efficient whole-genome scale genetic signature discovery.

## Key Features
1. Extracting variants and outputing 
2. Identifying and outputing genetic sigantures statisfying user-defined population frequency constraints.
3. Profiling user-defined sample group(s) for exclusively owned genetic signatures.
4.  
5. Identifying Short Tandem Repeats(STR) from multi-allelic loci and profiling based on expansion/contraction status.
6.
