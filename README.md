# Genetic Signature EXPlorer (GSEXP)

## Description
We provide a command-line tool used for fast and efficient whole-genome scale genetic signature discovery.

## Key Features
1. Basic variants extraction based on annotation flags.
2. Calculation of variant frequency based on user-defined sample group label.
3. Profiling exclusively owned genetic signatures of a single sample group or shared genetic signatures among multiple sample groups.
4. Identification of bi-allelic genetic signatures statisfying user-defined population frequency constraints.
5. Identification of Short Tandem Repeats(STR) from multi-allelic loci. Can profiling sample groups for STR signatures with extreme expansion or contraction status.
6. Independent discovery and validation of genetic sigantures in different variant datasets.
